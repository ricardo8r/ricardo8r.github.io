### About me
  I'm a postdoctoral researcher at EPFL in the [MCSS](https://www.epfl.ch/labs/mcss/) group of [Prof. Jan S. Hesthaven](https://www.epfl.ch/labs/mcss/members/hesthaven/). At the moment I work developing reduced basis methods for time evolving problems with applications in digital twins. It involves using some model reduction, a little bit of Laplace transforms and a lot of harmonic analysis. 

I did my Ph.D. in Civil engenieering at the Universitat Politecnica de Catalunya working with [Ramon Codina](https://deca.upc.edu/en/people/ramon.codina) and [Sergio Idelsohn](https://www.cimne.com/m1898/people/directory) in model reduction for fluid flows. My thesis: [Stabilized reduced order models for low speed flows]([https://iris.sissa.it/handle/20.500.11767/114329](https://upcommons.upc.edu/handle/2117/190157))

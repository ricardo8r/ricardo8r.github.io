### About me

I am a mechanical engineer that works developing numerical methods for time evolving problems, computational fluid dynamics and computational mechanics. At the moment I work developing reduced basis methods for time evolving problems with applications in digital twins.

I did my Ph.D. in Civil engenieering at the Universitat Politecnica de Catalunya working in model reduction for Navier-Stokes equations. My thesis: [Stabilized reduced order models for low speed flows]([https://iris.sissa.it/handle/20.500.11767/114329](https://upcommons.upc.edu/handle/2117/190157))  

### Research interests
* Reduced order models
  * Parametric PDEs
  * Time-dependent PDEs
* Computational fluid dynamics
  * Fluid-structure interaction
  * Non-newtonian fluids
  * Turbulence and chaotic behaviour

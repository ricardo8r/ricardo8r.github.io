Introductory class of mathematical modeling for engineering. Small introduction of ordinaria and partial differential equations. Exercises with some toy problems like the Lotkaâ€“Volterra equations, the wave equation or the heat equation. Most of the course was to develop a small project in Matlab depending of the interest of each student.
